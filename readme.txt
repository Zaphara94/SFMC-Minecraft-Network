SFMC MODDED NETWORK

This is a network of modded minecraft servers that are part of the SoFurry Minecraft network. They are uploaded and maintained by myself and few other people, as we are working on the development of these servers.

This GitHub is here for the sole purpose of keeping track of issues with these packs. Make sure, if you post an issue, to include the name of the pack you are playing in the title.
